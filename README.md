An open source Git repository management application, written in Swift.

## Motivation
It's pretty easy to [set up a Git server](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Setting-Up-the-Server) running on a host somewhere on the Internet. But then GitHub has given us all sorts of neat toys *around* a Git repositoryâ€“user management, permissions, team structure, online editing... It's great!

On the other hand, control freaks and paranoiacs like us need to own the servers in which our code is hosted. [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/downloads/) checks all our boxes, but in our experience, it's a resource hog. 

What to do?

The [Ada Web Server](http://libre.adacore.com/tools/aws/) might be a good choice: it gives you standalone binaries custom-crafted with your own code. We love [Ada](https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Subject:Ada_programming_language&redirect=no), but we don't see how investing time in it is a good idea for us right now.

Which brings us to [Swift](https://swift.org). Writing a Git management app in Swift will offer the speed of compiled binaries, the ease of use of GitHub, and the chance to build a big project in the new hotness.

Let's go!
